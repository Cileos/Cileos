cileos.com
==========

This repo contains the source used for the http://cileos.com page.

Until October 2014 it ran on heroku, but they turned off the support for
A-record domains and only accept CNAME. The (current) DNS provider only allows
us to set A. So we move that page to our own server.

It is a combined sinatra/middleman app based on rack and will be run with thin.

deploy
------

We mimic heroku-style deploy by just pushing to a remote repository.

First, you have to add it:

     $ git remote add live ssh://niklas@lanpartei.de:22117/home/niklas/app/current

And now, whenever you want to deploy:

     $ git push live master
